	abstract = {2014-10-22 (commit
5620e43):  Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, and the multiple computer science
and electronic cash innovations it brought, there has been great interest in the potential of
decentralised cryptocurrencies. At the same time, implementation changes to the consensus-
critical parts of Bitcoin must necessarily be handled very conservatively. As a result, Bitcoin has
greater difficulty than other Internet protocols in adapting to new demands and accommodating
new innovation.
We propose a new technology,
pegged sidechains
, which enables bitcoins and other ledger
assets to be transferred between multiple blockchains. This gives users access to new and
innovative cryptocurrency systems using the assets they already own. By reusing Bitcoin’s
currency, these systems can more easily interoperate with each other and with Bitcoin, avoiding
the liquidity shortages and market fluctuations associated with new currencies. Since sidechains
are separate systems, technical and economic innovation is not hindered. Despite bidirectional
transferability between Bitcoin and pegged sidechains, they are isolated: in the case of a
cryptographic break (or malicious design) in a sidechain, the damage is entirely confined to
the sidechain itself.
This paper lays out pegged sidechains, their implementation requirements, and the work
needed to fully benefit from the future of interconnected blockchains.},

I worked very hard to create this interactive audiobook format and graciously appreciate Bitcoin \& Cloakcoin Donations.


After wanting to read the original Bitcoin Whitepaper, I discovered there wasn't a good audiobook version of it with graphs and formulas.   So I went ahead and made it, using a slower reading speed so a viewer can try and take it all in.  

I have no affiliation with bitcoin.org or Satoshi Nakamoto.

Download the original whitepaper here.  http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

From wikipedia....
In November 2008, a paper was posted on the internet under the name Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. This paper detailed methods of using a peer-to-peer network to generate what was described as "a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust". In January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence with the release of the first open source Bitcoin client and the issuance of the first bitcoins, with Satoshi Nakamoto mining the first block of bitcoins ever (known as the "genesis block"), which had a reward of 50 bitcoins. The value of the first bitcoin transactions were negotiated by individuals on the bitcointalk forums with one notable transaction involving a 10,000 {BTC} pizza.  

"Satoshi Nakamoto" is a pseudonym for the unknown person or people who designed the original Bitcoin protocol in 2008 and launched the network in 2009. Nakamoto was responsible for creating the majority of the official Bitcoin software and was active in making modifications and posting technical information on the {BitcoinTalk} Forum.[73]

and its reliance on a distributed pseudononymous public ledger, this
anonymity is important if only to provide the same minimal privacy
protections from nosy neighbors o ered by conventional banking. Unfor-
tunately, at 25KB, the non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs for spending
a zerocoin are nearly prohibitively large. In this paper, we consider several
improvements. First, we strengthen Zerocoin's anonymity guarantees,
making them independent of the size of these proofs. Given this freedom,
we explore several techniques for drastically reducing proof size while
ensuring that forging a single zerocoin is more di cult than the block
mining process used to maintain Bitcoin's distributed ledger. Provided
a zerocoin is worth less than the reward for a Bitcoin block, forging a
coin is not an economically rational action. Hence we preserve Zerocoin's
absolute anonymity guarantees while achieving drastic reductions in proof
size by limiting ourselves to security against rational attackers.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin is the  rst digital currency to see widespread adoption. Although payments are conducted between pseudonyms, Bitcoin cannot o er strong privacy guarantees: payment transactions are recorded in a public decentralized ledger, from which much information can be deduced. Zerocoin (Miers et al., {IEEE} S\&P 2013) tackles some of these privacy issues by unlinking transactions from the payment's origin. Yet it still reveals payment destinations and amounts, and is limited in functionality.
In this paper, we construct a full- edged ledger-based digital currency with strong privacy guarantees. Our results leverage recent advances in
zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive
{ARguments} of Knowledge
(zk-{SNARKs}).
We formulate and construct
decentralized anonymous payment schemes
({DAP} schemes). A {DAP} scheme lets users pay each other directly and privately: the corresponding transaction
hides the payment's origin, destination, and amount. We provide formal de nitions and proofs
of the construction's security.
We then build Zerocash, a practical instantiation of our {DAP} scheme construction. In Zerocash, transactions are less than 1 {kB} and take under 6 ms to verify {\textbar} orders of magnitude
more e cient than the less-anonymous Zerocoin and competitive with plain Bitcoin.},

	title = {Scalable Zero Knowledge via Cycles of Elliptic Curves},
	url = {http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/595},
	abstract = {Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge for general {NP} statements are a powerful cryptographic primitive, both in theory and in practical applications. Recently, much research has focused on achieving an additional property, succinctness, requiring the proof to be very short and easy to verify. Such proof systems are known as zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-{SNARKs}), and are desired when communication is expensive, or the verifier is computationally weak.

Existing zk-{SNARK} implementations have severe scalability limitations, in terms of space complexity as a function of the size of the computation being proved (e.g., running time of the {NP} statement’s decision program). First, the size of the proving key is quasilinear in the upper bound on the computation size. Second, producing a proof requires "writing down" all intermediate values of the entire computation, and then conducting global operations such as {FFTs}.

The bootstrapping technique of Bitansky et al. ({STOC} ’13), following Valiant ({TCC} ’08), offers an approach to scalability, by recursively composing proofs: proving statements about acceptance of the proof system’s own verifier (and correctness of the program’s latest step). Alas, recursive composition of known zk-{SNARKs} has never been realized in practice, due to enormous computational cost.

Using new elliptic-curve cryptographic techniques, and methods for exploiting the proof systems’ field structure and nondeterminism, we achieve the first zk-{SNARK} implementation that practically achieves recursive proof composition. Our zk-{SNARK} implementation runs random-access machine programs and produces proofs of their correct execution, on today’s hardware, for any program running time. It takes constant time to generate the keys that support all computation sizes. Subsequently, the proving process only incurs a constant multiplicative overhead compared to the original computation’s time, and an essentially-constant additive overhead in memory. Thus, our zk-{SNARK} implementation is the first to have a well-defined, albeit low, clock rate of "verified instructions per second".},

	abstract = {Bitcoin in five minutes: Blockchain technology will drastically change our lives.

In the coming years, the technology behind crypto currencies such as Bitcoin will inevitably and radically change the role of traditional trusted parties such as banks, accountants, notaries, and governments. The animated video about Bitcoin that was released today on http://bitcoinproperly.org is the first to specifically address the technology behind Bitcoin: the Blockchain. Within five minutes, it is explained how the essential functions of the “trusted third party” can be automatized through the Blockchain as well as what the implications of this are.

From Bitcoin hype to Blockchain revolution: an internet of trust.
With the arrival of crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, everyone around the world can trade with each other without any involvement from traditional third parties such as banks, notaries, accountants, and governments. Trade is a fundamental pillar of our economy and society, and traditional trusted parties play a crucial role in this.

The technology behind Bitcoin making all this possible – the Blockchain – ensures that the essential functions of the “trusted third party’, are fully automatized through the internet. This way, these functions are as freely available, accessible, and programmable as the internet itself. 

The animated video, available in both Dutch and English, explains how this works, also mentioning practical applications. The implications are clear: in the coming years, the role of the traditional trusted parties will inevitably and drastically change, strongly impacting our daily lives.

The creators of this animated video invite its viewers to think about and discuss the fundamental and radical innovations made possible by crypto currencies.

Rutger van Zuidam ecommerce entrepreneur and founder of {IntoBitcoin}.com: “The Netherlands have all the assets to become Europe’s Silicon Valley of financial technology.

The technology behind crypto currencies like Bitcoin plays an essential role in leveraging these opportunities. We hope that the animated video about the technology behind crypto currencies will positively affect this development.”

Lykle de Vries: ”Bitcoin is not the new money for internet,but it is the new internet for money, value and ownership in all forms. Crypto currencies like Bitcoin are the next step in the emancipation of all world citizens, and can help create a new dynamic for democracy, society and economy.”

Well, this video will arm you with all the information you need to defend yourself. Bitcoin is not only, not a Ponzi scheme, but it seems likely that no investment could be less of a Ponzi scheme. 

But, while Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme, we do underline some realistic fears you need to consider as you move deeper into the Bitcoin world. And because Bitcoin is a great currency, there's an important distinction: just like dollars, euros and yen, you can run a ponzi scheme with bitcoin (remember that's not saying bitcoin is a ponzi scheme). Hope all of this helps when you get in those heated moments. Enjoy as James D'Angelo hostos.

The following are Wikipedia's paragraphs on Ponzi Schemes highlighted in our video

A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from their own money or the money paid by subsequent investors, rather than from profit earned by the individual or organization running the operation. Operators of Ponzi schemes usually entice new investors by offering higher returns than other investments, in the form of short-term returns that are either abnormally high or unusually consistent. The perpetuation of the high returns requires an ever-increasing flow of money from new investors to sustain the scheme.

The scheme is named after Charles Ponzi,who became notorious for using the technique in 1920.[3] Ponzi did not invent the scheme (for example, Charles Dickens' 1844 novel Martin Chuzzlewit and 1857 novel Little Dorrit each described such a scheme),[4] but his operation took in so much money that it was the first to become known throughout the United States. Ponzi's original scheme was based on the arbitrage of international reply coupons for postage stamps; however, he soon diverted investors' money to make payments to earlier investors and himself.

Carlo Pietro Giovanni Guglielmo Tebaldo Ponzi, (March 3, 1882 -- January 18, 1949), commonly known as Charles Ponzi, was an Italian businessman and con artist in the U.S. and Canada. His aliases include Charles Ponci, Carlo and Charles P. Bianchi.[1] Born in Italy, he became known in the early 1920s as a swindler in North America for his money making scheme. Charles Ponzi promised clients a 50\% profit within 45 days, or 100\% profit within 90 days, by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the United States as a form of arbitrage.[2][3] In reality, Ponzi was paying early investors using the investments of later investors. This type of scheme is now known as a "Ponzi scheme". His scheme ran for over a year before it collapsed, costing his "investors" \$20 million.
Ponzi was probably inspired by the scheme of William F. Miller, a Brooklyn bookkeeper who in 1899 used the same scheme to take in \$1 million. Video requested by Machobabba Zetlino.},

For reference, here's Wikpedia's first paragraph on Bitcoin

"Bitcoin is an open source peer-to-peer payment network and digital currency introduced in 2009 by pseudonymous developer "Satoshi Nakamoto". Bitcoin has been called a cryptocurrency because it uses cryptography to secure funds. Transactions transfer bitcoins, the unit of currency, between Bitcoin addresses derived from cryptographic public keys. To spend the funds associated with an address, a user must broadcast a payment message digitally signed with the associated private key. Transactions are verified by a decentralized network of computers all over the world. Specialized computers use a proof-of-work system to prevent people from copying and spending the same bitcoin multiple times, a problem for digital currencies known as double-spending. The operators of these computers, known as "miners", are rewarded with transaction fees and newly minted bitcoins."

	abstract = {Bitcoin security? {UGH}!!!

Bitcoin does so many things better than banks (trusts, escrows, programmable money, cheap transfers, instant accounts, etc.), but one area that is not quite so nice, is security. 

While the bitcoin network, itself, appears bullet-proof, lots of bitcoins are being stolen, via hacking, malware and flaws in online wallets and even google's random number generator. 

The answer is to get your bitcoins entirely offline, and the two ways to do this are paper wallets and cold storage. This video is an introduction to making both. Host, James D'Angelo, walks you through the software and ideas used in making 'sloppy' offline wallets (which are great to have). He also gives suggestions at making even better offline wallets. This is the first of many videos we will make on bitcoin security, and the least technical.

We hope you'll enjoy.

Here's the private keys we generate in this video with their public addresses! 
{PRIVATE} {KEY} \#1 (we sent one dollar to this one on Jan 5th) 5KNhmaUuPNeau7KptEhWefEcAwfMim8VABR6QhJH8JHAFBbnCe5
{PUBLIC} {ADDRESS} 17SwcawAtnCQmemPDDBGurd28tTbEbuK5z
You can see it live here
https://blockchain.info/address/17SwcawAtnCQmemPDDBGurd28tTbEbuK5z

{PRIVATE} {KEY} \#2 (we didn't send any funds to this one) 5J2VYxJsAktgLZ7PWNevxAEPFaKPftCYhyi1VxMHzT56kLTwtLY 
{PUBLIC} {ADDRESS} \#2 19ZxxVTac6zxH9a9xqXhtntepTLosFa8F9
You can see it live here
https://blockchain.info/address/19ZxxVTac6zxH9a9xqXhtntepTLosFa8F9

These keys will work forever, and are open wallets. You can play with them, send tiny amounts of bitcoins (very tiny because the funds in these wallets are spendable by anyone because the private key is public) and you can even withdraw the funds in them if there is still some left!!! nice.

This is part two of our bitcoin security series. Here's the intro to the series...

=========

Bitcoin security? {UGH}!!! Way too many bitcoins are being stolen by crafty malware programmers.

Bitcoin does so many things better than banks (trusts, escrows, programmable money, cheap transfers, instant accounts, etc.), but one area that is not quite so nice, is security. 

While the bitcoin network, itself, appears bullet-proof, lots of bitcoins are being stolen, via hacking, malware and flaws in online wallets and even google's random number generator. 

The answer is to get your bitcoins entirely offline, and the two ways to do this are paper wallets and cold storage. The previous video is an introduction to making both, while this video focuses on how to get your bitcoins out of cold storage (to spend, to move to another wallet, etc). 

James walks you through the software and ideas used in making 'sloppy' offline wallets (which are great to have). He also gives suggestions at making even better offline wallets. This is the first of many videos we will make on bitcoin security, and the least technical.

We hope you'll enjoy.

https://coinbase.com/

Usually, with our normal videos we cover just one feature or one idea, but because Coinbase is so easy to use, we can do a bunch. In this video we are going to open an account on Coinbase, send bitcoins to email addresses and bitcoin addresses, receive bitcoins and yes, we're even going to buy and sell some {BTC}. Amazing. 

Even though we will move slowly, chatting the whole way there will still be time left for discussing the pros and cons of the Coinbase system (one that is likely to be imitated around the world. But, we must a agree with Bloomberg, and it leaves us to wonder -- how great it would be if every country had a Coinbase? Enjoy.

https://coinbase.com/

Bigest problem with Coinbase? Well for us, who enjoy learning how bitcoin works, Coinbase keeps us too far removed from the mechanics and the technology. If you're the type who needs to be in full control of your money (you keep your gold in a hole in your back yard) well again, Coinbase isn't for you.

Note: If you are in Europe check out Safello.com. We haven't used it, but it looks like a nice alternative to Coinbase.

	abstract = {Anonymity is great. And Bitcoin provides anonymous payments better than anything we've seen online. But what few realize is that Bitcoin also does transparency, and it does transparency better than anything we've ever seen in human history. This transparency is the focus of this first video looking at bitcoin as a revolution. Because bitcoin is the first ever tool (in human history) that can provide provable transparency, we could finally see transparency explode via the free market (competitive edges given to those who disclose). This one simple change seems innocuous but it could have major repercussions.

Intro:

When people talk about bitcoin, they talk about a revolution. The trouble is, many people can't even figure out what the revolution is. Is it really a revolution to have lower fees on credit cards and remittances? While these are big changes, they are hardly revolutionary. This series begins to look at the bigger picture, the jaw dropping changes that bitcoin could provide. And no future may be stranger or more earth shattering than the inherent capabilities of bitcoin to provide a free market for transparency. And this isn't transparency like we are used to, this is the possibility of absolute financial transparency. Not only would it eliminate the need for the {IRS}, but it stands to erase corruption and improve government. Amazing stuff. Hope you enjoy.

	abstract = {Just like the Wright brothers, on those first flights at Kitty Hawk, didn't concern themselves that much with landing. And improvements like anti-lock brakes and seat belts help protect passengers in cars. Bitcoin is now in that 'second phase' where security is becoming massively important. Fortunately, because the currency is programmable, anything is really possible. Originally introduced into the bitcoin client a few years ago, multisignature addresses massively more secure than regular ones. Their adoption by all wallet manufacturers is coming. But, for you techies and voyeurs, we'll jump inside the ideas of multi-sig and even program the stuff. Hope you enjoy.

All the public and private keys are at the bottom of this description

James' code can be found here:
https://github.com/wobine/blackboard101
there, you'll see the code for part one and two of this video

Jeff Garzik's Bitcoin python library is here
https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc
remember to replace his connection.py file with ours for multisigs

And a little bit about bitcoind is here
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoind
but remember that it really is the most bare-bones bitcoin wallet software, but the one which allows the most programming. we love it.

A multisig wallet is already in production: Check it out
https://www.bitgo.com/
We're still waiting to see how they use multisig to see if it really works for the end user.

And finally, here's our lovely multisig address
http://live.bitcore.io/address/35Z3xG92YkW5Xo4ngQw6w5b3Ce6MDw94A8
So cool to see it live and in action.

Part Two - Spending From the Multisignature Address

This part two of a two part series on muti-signature addresses and wallets. This is important technology for massively improving bitcoin security. In part one we generated a multisig address/wallet. In this part, we'lll walk you through all the steps necessary to spend the funds, going line by line through some simple python code and generating a payment in bitcoind. 

In many ways, multisig addresses are the answer to most of bitcoin's concerns and fears of theft. And now its time to scale up massive implementation for them. Originally introduced into the bitcoin client a few years ago, multisignature addresses massively more secure than regular ones. Their adoption by all wallet manufacturers is coming.

While a 51\% attack doesn't appear to offer a lot of financial gain, monetary gain may not be the motive of the attacker. In part one, we go through a cost analysis of the current hardware needed to launch a successful 51\% attack to get a better picture how much it might cost. Unfortunately, the numbers are lower than expected, and most of the previously published values come in three to fifty times higher than actuality. In part two we will talk more about what an attacker might be able to do (double spending is not the worse tool at their disposal) and we prod at some possible solutions. Stay tuned.

	abstract = {There is no greater point of weakness in Bitcoin than a 51\% attack. A fifty-one percent attack can shut down the network. This video discusses all the attack vectors available to an attacker. And there are many, even worse, the devastation available is catastrophic. While a 51\% attack doesn't appear to offer a lot of financial gain, history is not just made up of rational actors. 

James goes through Transaction Denial of Service, Selfish Mining, Monopoly Mining and Double Spending, finding fault with proposed patches and solutions. It is not pretty. As Gavin Andresen says, if someone was able to run a 51\% attack "that would be bad". We agree. It would be very bad. 

At the end of the video we discuss protocol changes that would make an attack much more difficult. We highlight Proof of Stake as a fallback algorithm. The biggest advantage is that {POS} provides a {MUCH} higher cost to the attacker for perpetrating such an attack. That, would be good.

	abstract = {(A fully rewritten introductory video).

Having trouble understanding Bitcoin? Well, even Bitcoin's anonymous developer, Satoshi Nakamoto, commented on how difficult it is to explain Bitcoin to a beginner. 

But we've been teaching Bitcoin for over a year now and we're starting to figure it out. This video is the result of a talk we did at Harvard University in April 2014 for Bitcoin beginners. Many of them mentioned that this talk helped them to finally understood the basic idea and we hope it works for you too. Even better, it is a story, covering the failures and difficulties of creating a digital currency, so for non-techies it is more accesible as well.

	abstract = {Welcome to part four in our series on Elliptic Curve Cryptography. I this episode we dive into the development of the public key. In just 44 lines of code, with no special functions or imports, we produce the elliptic curve public key for use in Bitcoin. Better still, we walk you through it line by line, constant by constant. Nothing makes the process clearer and easier to understand than seeing it in straight forward code. If you've been wondering about the secp256k1 (arguably the most important piece of code in Bitcoin), well then this is the video for you.

This is part 4 of our upcoming series on Elliptic Curves. Because of such strong requests, even though this is part 4, it is the first one we are releasing.  In the next few weeks we will release the rest of the series. Enjoy.
