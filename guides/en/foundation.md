    The [Education Committee](https://btcfoundationedcom.github.io/) has created a list of best-practices guides on its [Github repository](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/guides/README.md).

9. **What are the rules for participating on the Foundation's forum? Why is the Foundation's forum available to read by non-members?**

    The member forums are a place for open discussion of ideas. Members have considerable freedom to post their thoughts, reactions, and feedback, but should be aware of a few basic pointers aimed at keeping discussion focused.
    	
    Respecting the following rules will add to productive discussions and maximize potential interaction among membership.
    
    >	- Be polite. Do not attack or insult other members.
    >
    
    >	- Be professional. Use language that you would use in a professional work setting.
    >
    
    >	- Be concise. Avoid "tl;dr" ("too long, didn't read") walls-of-text posts.
    >
    
    >	- Stay on topic. If in doubt, start a new topic.

    Breaking these rules will result in intervention from moderators. Additionally, members may elect to ignore content from members deemed to be distracting or objectionable ("ignore preferences" in forum settings).
    
    Repeated violations of the rules may result in moderator warnings, transition to moderator pre-approval of postings (modqueue), and suspension of posting privileges. Members are encouraged to [report content that they find objectionable.](https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/943-message-from-the-mod-keeping-discussions-on-topic-reporting-content-to-the-mods/#entry10842)
    
    The member forums were made [read-only to guests in January, 2014.](https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/646-notice-of-change-in-forum-viewing-settings/#entry7414) Previously, all access to member forums required member credentials. This change was made in order to exemplify the Foundation's position on transparency and to encourage communication with the broader community.
