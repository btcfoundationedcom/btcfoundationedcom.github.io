## Guidelines: Social Media Strategy and Presence for the Education Committee of the Bitcoin Foundation

### Three General Ideas: Details

1) The general guiding concept which should be applied by participating members of the Education Committee, relating to the Committee's efforts in social media fora, is that persons participating, ideas contributed, and modes of communication utilized will be diverse and decentralized.  However, there should be a consistent name that is associated with the Education Committee's activities across all social fora.  If the name of the account is @XYZ on twitter, it should also be XYZ on facebook, and so on.  If it's not possible for them to be exactly the same, that's ok, but there should be an effort to have consistency in the actual username for the Education Committee as represented across social platforms or fora.

2) Education and information is key, and it should be delivered in simple and easy-to-digest chunks that would enable anyone to get needed information - quickly.  To that end, we need to approach those who are informed and those who have not yet received much - or any - information about bitcoin in the same way, with short, useful takeaways that add understanding, broaden perspectives, and ease adoption.  In this process there will be a diversity of perspectives from different participants and social media contributors, and some ideas presented and published by some contributors to the Education Committee's social media account(s) will inevitably conflict with perspectives and ideas presented and published to the Education Committee social media account(s) by  other Education Committee contributors who will also have posting privileges.  That's ok, it's all part of the diversity of perspectives.  There will be a natural disharmony which emanates from splashing around and exploring various ideas ~ what could be referred to as a 'fabulous discord.'  The important thing is that, as best we can, we should keep the information that is published short, useful, and simple with an eye to adding understanding, broadening perspectives, and easing adoption.

3) To disseminate information, we go where people already are and move outward from there.  
In some ways this will be similar to the *Antishock Theory,* which is partially described as follows:
 
          Simple, universal, connected, and active

    There is no difference between a well defined idea and a well understood machine.
    Once we map one model, we understand all of them.
    Relations in maps show us behaviors in models.
    Ideas move to show relations without mapping every angle.
    
Classical examples of platforms where this process can begin are 'twitter' (approx. 646 million active registered users, producing 58 million tweets per day) or 'facebook' (approx. 1.3 billion monthly active users, with 4.5 billion average daily "likes").  If we have members who are competent in Chinese or Russian, we should explore account creation on 'Sina Weibo' (a Chinese social media platform with well over 500 million registered users involving 100 million messages posted per day) and 'VK' (a primarily Russian platform similar to facebook, with 240 million accounts and 55 million daily users).  It may be too easy for many Foundation participants to collectively present a mostly USA-centric face, and thus, the Education Committee must broaden cultural reach and disseminate information in fora that are considered routine for Chinese, Russian, and other users ~ by tapping into the expertise and cultural awareness of people who live in or are deeply familiar with those zones. With some presence initially built in these areas, we should begin expanding to other areas, such as 'diaspora' (an twitter-compatible alternative), 'twister' (a decentralized peer-to-peer microblogging platform leveraged on bitcoin and bittorrent), and the 'status' platform.  Rather than "migrating" or "jumping" from one platform to the next, this process will involve an "expansion" of social presence as the number and type of tools or platforms we use grows. This process results in retention of our presence on any accounts or platforms we have started on as we gradually expand outward into various social fora.  As the Education Committee's presence gradually evolves, and as new tools evolve, we can eventually expand our presence to what are now platforms under development, such as 'TrsstProject' (encrypted, anonymized, decentralized twitter alternative, building on RSS technology) or 'BitTorrent Chat Alpha' (private instant messaging via secure distributed technology ~ not social per se, but may be a means to redefine part of how the Education Committee presents itself socially).

#### Moving Towards Full Use Of (Rather than Tolerating) Open Source Solutions

Bitcoin began as, and remains, an open source project.  It is vital that we move towards open source and decentralized solutions generally instead of slowing our own or others' adoption processes by insisting upon continued use of proprietary, closed-source operating systems and related software.  While this is an effort which has many dimensions, in the realm of social fora, we should work towards configuring our tools to use open source, decentralized software to interface with those who are still using proprietary operating systems and commonly used web-based services.  As we do this, our expressions, communication efforts and methods, etc., should remain generally indistinguishable from those methods used by most people in any particular social environment.

An example of an open-source operating system that provides the means to interface with facebook (as an example) is Ubuntu, which comes with Empathy (and Gwibber, which allows you to log in to a large number of social platforms and fora).  While Empathy does not yet support OTR, it does allow you to skip adding any jabber/XMPP accounts that you normally would only communicate with while using OTR (adding your jabber/XMPP accounts into Empathy is probably not recommended for those who value the privacy afforded by tools like Pidgin with OTR and Adium).  After skipping the step of adding jabber/XMPP accounts, it's then a quick step to begin using Empathy to chat with your friends who use facebook, using any existing facebook username and password you have. For general purpose video conferencing, Jitsi (with videobridge installed) is an open source solution that will work on all platforms.

#### Multi-Member Publishing to Any Account:  An "Open Social Stack"

Our strategy must be inclusive of the many ideas that are in our group and at the same time must exhibit decentralization.  Thus, an "open social stack" should be formed, to be composed of three to six members who are willing to have their message (or content they find) be tweeted (or facebook'd, or Weibo'd, or...). [The term "open social stack" is used here very loosely, please give it whatever meaning you wish.  For some background and possible ideas, see:
John Henry Clippinger and David Bollier's 'The Social Stack for New Social Contracts' on the idcubed[dot]org blog.]

Some programs enable you to designate team leaders that will review the contributed content and it will be those team leaders that then clear it to be published, such as the social media collaboration concept of HootSuite.
Some services that tie into social media platforms allow you to schedule or delay when tweets will appear.  Some examples of this are ArgyleSocial, Buffer, and HootSuite.

#### Transparency and Original Content

Transparency is vital, so participants who are given credentials to the Education Committee account(s) will need to minimize the use of the direct or private messaging function when using the Education Committee social accounts.  Additionally, all persons who are contributors / participants / team members will disclose their names or chosen pseudonyms, so that the list of participating contributors can be known and published on a Bitcoin Foundation website, forum, or other public place(s).  Original content is vital, so seeking out or posting original content is what should be done.  Retweeting your own content from your own social account is not desirable and should not be done, but if you have found or tweeted from your own personal twitter, facebook posted, etc., some content that you think is just extraordinary, toss it into the hopper; either you will post it or a team lead will clear it (if Hoot is being used) for publication.  However, the tweets, facebook posts, etc., must be original and should not be reposts or RT's of your own microblogging activity.


#### Sharing of Credentials, No Bans, Voluntary Participation, Security

Insecure admins sometimes turn to temporary bans or full bans as a form of nepotism, inviting in their friends or like-minded persons to replace people that they do not agree with.  This cannot be done here with the social media activity on shared accounts of the Education Committee.  People who agree to participate as contributors to the social media activity of the Education Committee will do so voluntarily, and will leave voluntarily.  If there is any issue it can be worked out in conference amongst the participants, but bans are not acceptable (whether they are attempted to be justified by unilateral action or "by vote").  Participants will need to work out their differences, and if they cannot do so regarding any issues or differences that may arise relating to messaging or content delivery in connection with Education Committee social presence, they should consider stepping back from the social media fora so that they can gain some perspective.  All participants (it is estimated the maximum number of contributors may range from three to six, but this is not absolute) will have the ability to post and cannot be "voted down."  The exception to this is that if team leaders are established (with an example being the HootSuite model), the team leaders decide what proposed tweets, facebook posts, etc., will be cleared for publication, but this should not be understood to grant anything special to team leaders, who should clear everything for publication unless something is clearly wrong (obvious errors, threat of violence in a proposed tweet, or broken links).  If team leaders / social collaboration is utilized, the team leaders will be cycled out periodically so that everyone has a chance to be a team leader.

The final point to be made here is on the topic of Security.  Wherever possible some sort of two-factor authentication should be employed to safeguard the account(s).  If this is not possible due to the number of persons who will need to have credentials to the account, it may make sense to use a service that can handle the 'team leader / contributor / collaboration' concepts in the context of social media teams.  When a contributor / participant voluntarily leaves the scene (is done contributing, moves on and is no longer contributing to social), the remaining team should convene and generate new password(s) (if that person had admin level privilege to the account(s)) so that the person or persons who have left the Education Committee social account team does not unexpectedly post to that account.  Whoever generates an account as the Education Committee undergoes expansion into different social fora is responsible for defense of that account and, if the account is lost to a hack or some other issue, making reasonable, polite, and non-litigious attempts to reclaim the account for the Education Committee's purposes.
