# Bitcoin Foundation Education Committee

From the three goals of the Foundation (standardization, protection and promotion of Bitcoin), the education committee is focused on promotion. To promote Bitcoin, the committee further focuses on two areas:

1. The production of best-practice guides that members of the general public can turn to for information about Bitcoin and its potential. The committee has already created some high-quality content, and that content can be found in this Github repository under [guides](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/tree/master/guides). The committee aims to decentralize content creation, which is currently done by a small group of dedicated committee members and, towards that goal, the committee is testing the use of Github.

2. The establishment of relations between the Foundation and academic institutions around the world. Work has already been started in this area with several members of our committee contacting student groups and professors in various colleges and universities.
