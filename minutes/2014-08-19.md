## Updates and Action Items

1. The members present debated how the committee could categorize existing educational materials about Bitcoin. There were proposals for various categories but it was decided that a more thorough discussion should take place publicly and on Github. Nikos Bentenitis has created a [Github issue](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/issues/30) with the rationale of the project and some guidelines for submissions.

2. The next meeting of the education committee will take place at 11:30 am Eastern Time (6:30 pm Central European Time), on August 26. All members in the [education committee mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-foundation-education-committee) will receive a reminder 24 hours before the meeting.
