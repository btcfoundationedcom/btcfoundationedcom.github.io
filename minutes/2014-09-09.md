## Updates and Action Items

1. Nikos announced that there has been several additions to the committee's educational materials database. Some of the entries came from community input through the [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bDA-s3yfhkxfHkz_F426Gov6xpdEfSJzmYN0unyO9bs/viewform). The entries can be seen in the following [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AHQpAL_ENG2guFMGqLmoNvG0QFk3bCRTYRMeT-CjBzQ)

2. Nikos asked everybody to refocus their attention to entering and reviewing materials in the committee's [Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/bfeducomm).

3. The next meeting of the education committee will take place at 6 pm Eastern Time (12 midnight Central European Time), on September 30. The two-week hiatus is due to Nikos' heavy travel obligations. All members in the [education committee mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-foundation-education-committee) will receive a reminder 24 hours before the meeting.
