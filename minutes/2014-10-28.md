# Education Committee Meeting Minutes - October 28, 2014

## Attendees

- Colin Gallagher
- Nikos Bentenitis
- Sandy Ressler
- Valerian Bennett

## Updates and Action Items

1. Colin Gallagher suggested that the educational resources that the committee has been collected should be included in the Github repository. Nikos will be posting the updated list of references on [this page](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/resources/README.md) on a regular basis.

2. Colin shared with the committee a few projects that have come to his attention as worthwhile. These include the [WebCrypto API](http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/) and a few Bitcoin wallets. Sandy Ressler suggested that the committee could maintain a list of interesting projects in the space. Nikos thought the idea was useful but might be difficult to implement since the quality of projects can vary widely. A brief discussion took place about recent additions to the repository that relate to the security of cryptocurrency wallets.

3. The next meeting of the education committee will take place on Tuesday, November 4 at 6:30 pm Eastern Time. All members in the [education committee mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-foundation-education-committee) will receive a reminder 24 hours before the meeting.
