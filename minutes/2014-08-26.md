## Updates and Action Items

1. Nikos Bentenitis summarized the discussion that took place on [Github](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/issues/30) about the categories that the committee can use to organize educational materials about Bitcoin. A [this Doodle poll](http://doodle.com/qs76ivvbwcgzqnbp) will be used to determine the winning categories.

2. In order to help members of the Bitcoin community submit links with educational materials about Bitcoin, [an online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bDA-s3yfhkxfHkz_F426Gov6xpdEfSJzmYN0unyO9bs/viewform) has been set up. The members present at the meeting, agreed that a good start for those categories are those suggested by [David A. Harding](https://github.com/harding) (Bitcoin for individuals, Bitcoin for organizations, Bitcoin for developers, Bitcoin for policy makers and the press.) Those categories will be changed based on the result of [the Doodle poll](http://doodle.com/qs76ivvbwcgzqnbp).

	Using the form, anybody can submit a link and. if at least one member of the committee adds the link to the resource database that the committee maintains, the link will appear on the committees [public Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/bfeducomm/items/). There is a disclaimer on the form that mentions that 

	> The committee members cannot guarantee that they will be able to review all submitted links, so please consider this form a way to help the committee discover good educational materials about Bitcoin, and not an official communication with the committee or the Bitcoin Foundation.
